# Youtube dark theme by Vallek

I tried couple other dark themes and had problems with them so I decided to make another one)

## Compatible with

* [My other Youtube custom style](https://github.com/Vallek/vallek-youtube-custom-css) that hides annoying stuff and let you set number of videos in a row.

## Works on:

* Subscriptions screen
* Video screen
* Live screen with chat

## Features

You can change colors by changing variables in the beginning (dark, light, darkish).

## Updates

Last update: 11.2025

Tested on stable Chrome and Firefox on Windows 10.

I'm planning to update it when and if something will break but no promises. If you found a bug please report it in Issues here. It may be not 100% complete and google changes stuff all the time.
